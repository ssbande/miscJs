# Problem Statements - LEVEL EASY

## ARRAYs >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
###### 01. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

###### 02. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II 
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

###### 03. Rotate Array
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note: Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

###### 04. Contains Duplicate
Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates. Your function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and it should return false if every element is distinct.

###### 05. Single Number
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

###### 06. Plus one
Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.
You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

###### 07. Move Zeroes
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]. after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Note:
  * You must do this in place without making a copy of the array.
  * Minimize the total number of operations.

###### 08. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. 
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
[2, 7, 11, 15] target = 9 return [0,1]

###### 09. Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

###### 10. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. 
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

121 > true
-121 > false 
10 > false

.... Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

###### 11. Roman to Integer
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
  I             1
  V             5
  X            10
  L            50
  C           100
  D           500
  M          1000

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 
Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. 
The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. 
The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. 

There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. 
Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


###### 12. Longest Common Prefix 
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
